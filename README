The electron platform is an expert system platform designed to further my own
interests in expert systems. It is a fork of the adventure engine only in that
I wanted an already hacked base.

Eventually, this platform will act as the base of the adventure engine but that
is a long ways away.

Some of the things that I want to explore in the electron platform are:

1) Direct assembly construction in the expert system (Some LISP implementations
   allow this)
2) A widget system (I started this already in a way with the adventure engine
   but I find that so purpose driven that it's actually boring).
3) Scene graph processing. This will be similar to my masters thesis of using
   an expert system to apply wavefront scheduling to code except with 2d and 3d
   graphics.
4) Control of 2d and 3d graphics directly from the engine
5) A way to automate the process of porting electron to platforms such as
   opencl to greatly enhance computing.
6) Implementing implicit bignum support
7) Networking

AND MUCH MUCH MORE.....

This platform will have many branches and some of them will be integrated back
into the mainline but expect tons of branches with many leading nowhere
existing as a testament to research and trying new things.

I am currently writing a tool chain for this project. Change to the
theoretical-emulator branch to see the status of it. Generally speaking, I try
to merge it back to master but I sometimes forget
